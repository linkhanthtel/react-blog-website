# WanderLuxe Ventures 

WanderLuxe Ventures is a blog website built with React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. This documentation provides an overview of the project structure, key components, and development guidelines.

- Frontend: React (Single Page Application)
- Backend: FastAPI (Python-based REST API)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

### State Management

We use a combination of React Context API and local component state for state management. The main contexts are:

1. **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state.
2. **BlogContext**: Manages global blog post state.

### Styling

We use a tailwind and react-icons along with v0.dev

## Backend (FastAPI)

(This section is under development. The following is a placeholder structure.)

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

The React frontend is deployed on Vercel. To deploy:

1. Push your changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository
2. Vercel will automatically build and deploy the changes

### Backend Deployment

(This section will be completed once the backend development is finished.)
